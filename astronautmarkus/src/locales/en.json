The plot is simple, but I really liked the relationship between the protagonists, the witch and magic plot, and the animation in general. Plus, the opening is very catchy. I have a special feeling for this series, it's hard to explain. It's like the scene in Ratatouille where the critic remembers his childhood with the food. It's my trip to the past in the time when I was happiest.",
  "witchCraftWorksPros": "Simple and fun series, good animation for 2014, catchy opening, relationship between the protagonists, etc.",
